# Dogs vs. Cats
## Create an algorithm to distinguish dogs from cats

This project created for [this](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats "Dogs vs. Cats") Kaggle contest. 

This was a project I was assigned in my Artificial Intelligence course in college. I became enamored with Machine Learning but unfortunately I did not have the time I needed to dedicate myself to the project. After graduation I decided to revisit this project to get a better understand Machine Learning and see if I could improve my testing set accuracy. The code in MakeNN.py generated a model with an accuracy of about 95%. I decided to move on to other models after I reached that benchmark on this one. 

This was my first foray into Machine Learning.
